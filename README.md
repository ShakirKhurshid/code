1.*SGDR* This is a Pytorch implementation of training a model (Resnet-50) using differential learning rate . The optimizer used is Stochiastic Gradient descent with RESTARTS ( SGDR) that uses Cosine Annealing  which decreases learning rate in the form of half a cosine curve. Cycling the learning rate allows the network to get out of spiky minima and enter a more robust one.

2.*Transformer* This is a mini-project. It takes in an image of a motorcycle License plate and uses image processing to straighten it. The aim of this project was to straighten tilted license plates for easy License place Text Extraction
